every thing in javascript is object
we can use"{}" these breakets to make objects
like let student={
name : "john",
id: 321
}
we also can include many functions in js
and make function with the keyword "function" like this
<===function sayhi(message)
{
	console.log(message)
}
//this is calling function
sayhi("hi")===>

we can define function when we are calling(by doing this we save our time because we do not need to define function first(Anonymus function))
We can also call a function in another function(call back function)
 why we need nodejs ???

because we are using V8 engine of chrome and whole files didnot load there
so we start using node js that has v8 engine and we donot need any browser and also we can handle whole files here
